# Deep Learning Specialization
This repository contains the assignments and projects done as part of the Deep Learning [Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) on Coursera by Andrew Ng.

## Current Progress

  - [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) : DONE
  - [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network) : DONE
  - [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects) : DONE (Note : this had no assignments, just really awesome quizzes)
  - [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks) : DONE
  - [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models) : IN PROGRESS
